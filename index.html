            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                Kobe Bean Bryant was born August 23, 1978 in Philadelphia, Bryant was the youngest of 3 children to former NBA player Joe Bryant and Pamela Cox Bryant.
                His parent's named him after Japanese Kobe beef, his middle name coming from his fathers nickname "Jellybean".
            </p>
            <p>
                Bryant first started playing basketball at the age of 3, and his favourite team were the LA Lakers. At the age of six Bryant's father retired from the NBA
                and moved the family to Italy to continue his basketball career. During this time, Bryant learnt fluent Italian and became accustomed to the new lifestyle.
                He even joined a local youth team in Reggio Emilia when he was aged 12. Bryant's grandfather would mail him videos of NBA games to study.
                He would also return to the United States during summers to take part in summer basketball leagues. At age 13, Bryant's family moved back to Philadelphia and 
                he enrolled in eighth grade at Bala Cynwyd Middle School.

            <h2>High School</h2>
            <p>
                Bryant went to Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, where he earned national recognition. He played on the varsity team becoming the first freshman to 
                start on the team for decades. His freshman year was not a success for the team with their final record being 4-20. The following three years were very
                 successful with the team compiling a record of 77-13. During his junior year Bryant averaged 31.1 points, 10.4 rebounds, 5.2 assists, 3.8 blocks and 
                 2.3 steals. He was named Pennsylvania Player of the Year and earned a fourth-team Parade All-American nomination. This garnered attraction from college 
                 recruiters in the process. Duke, Michigan, North Carolina and Villanova were at the top of his list, but after Kevin Garnett went directly from High 
                 School to the first round of the 1995 NBA draft, Bryant began contemplating doing the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                In his senior year at high school Bryant led the Aces to its first state championship for 53 years. During this run he averaged 30.8 points, 12 rebounds, 
                6.5 assists, 4 steals, amd 3.8 blocks, leading the team to a 31-3 record. During practice before the semifinal's, Bryant broke his nose during practice 
                whilst diving for a loose ball. His coaches didn't know if he would or could play? Would he wear a mask? Could he get through the game? During the warm 
                up he practiced with a mask, and he didn't like how it felt. He went back to the locker room, threw the mask against the wall and said "Guys, let's go 
                to war. I'm not wearing this thing". Bryant's high school coach, Greg Downer claimed this is the moment he knew the team would win the championship.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bryant took the decision to go directly from high school into the NBA, at the time being only the sixth player in history to do so. Bryant became the first 
                guard to do this as all others who made the jump previously were big men.

            <h2>Professional Career</h2>
            <p>
                At the 1996 NBA draft, Bryant was the 13<sup>th</sup> pick by the Charlotte Hornets. The Hornets agreed to trade the pick for LA Lakers centre Vlade Divac. 
                Divac nearly caused the whole deal to collapse, when he initially threatened to retire rather than be traded from the Lakers. Divac eventually relented and 
                the trade was made official on July 9, 1996.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a rookie, Bryant mostly came off the bench but gained more playing time over the course of the season. He ended the season averaging 15.5 minutes. He 
                became the youngest NBA started aged 18 years and 158 days. During the 1997 All-Star weekend, Bryant participated in the Rookie Challenge and won the Slam 
                Dunk Contest, becoming the youngest champion. His play earned him a spot on the NBA All-Rookie Second Team.
            </p>
            <p>
                In his second season he gained a lot more playing time, show casing more of his ability. His points per game average doubled from 7.6 to 15.4. He was voted to
                 start at the NBA All-Star Game, becoming the youngest All-Star. He played alongside teammates O'Neal, Van Excel and Jones. At the end of the season, Bryant 
                 was runner up in the Sixth Man of the Year Award.
            </p>
            <p>
                A few seasons in his career exploded. He won three championships in a row (2000, 2001, 2002), playing alongside Shaquille O'Neal and coached by Phil Jackson. 
                Bryant and O'Neal didn't have the best of relationships and this eventually led to O'Neal being traded to the Miami Heat. The following years were a dry spell 
                for the team. On a personal level Bryant still had some success. He scored a career-high 81 points in a 122-104 victory against the Toronto Raptors. This was a 
                new franchise record and the second highest total in NBA history. He also led the league in scoring during the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 seasons.
            </p>
            <p>
                The glory days returned for the team in 2009 winning the NBA Championship, Bryant's fourth title and he was named the finals MVP. The following season this was 
                repeated, Bryant's fifth and final championship, again being named the finals MVP. The team chased a sixth championship but it wasn't forthcoming. Later in his 
                career he became injury prone. He ruptured his Achilles tendon, suffered a lateral tibial plateau fracture in his left knee and tore his rotator cuff.
