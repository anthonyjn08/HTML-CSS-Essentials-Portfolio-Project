# **Kobe Bryant - LA Laker Legend**
## **Aim of the site**
The aim of my site is to give people a look into the career and also small look into the life of basketball legend Kobe Bryant. Kobe Bryant was an American Professional basketball player, who spent his entire 20 year career playing for the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA. Bryant was one of few players to make the jump directly from high school direct to the NBA. His game was modelled on his idol Michael Jordan. By the end of his career, he was looked upon as his generations Michael Jordan and his influence on younger generations is just as strong. The website is aimed at fans of Kobe, the LA Lakers basketball team, NBA fans or just people, such as younger, newer fans of the game looking to gain knowledge of Bryant and his career.
