# Kobe Bryant tribute site.

The aim of my site is to give people a look into the life and career of basketball legend Kobe Bryant. It is aimed at fans of Kobe, the LA Lakers basketball team, NBA fans or just people looking to gain knowledge of Bryant and his career.

I will have a bio of Bryant's life on the 1st page, his career stats on the 2nd and a competition on the 3rd.
